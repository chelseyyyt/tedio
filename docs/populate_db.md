General notes
- Should values for videos be binary (e.g. this video does/does not promote kindness) or based on a scale? 
    - Accuracy: Is ChatGPT more accurate with one than another?
    - Selection: Would the eventual logic to choose whether or not to recommend a video be harder with one than another?
