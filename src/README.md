Backend + frontend workflow
- Get end-to-end connection working: /age and /values on the react app should lead to console logs on the FLASK side -- DONE 7/15
- Backend work:
    - add in / route for homepage
    - /age -- DONE
        - receive json req and return response message
        - send age in a query to users DB
    - /values -- DONE
        - receive json req and return response message
        - send values in a query to users DB
- Frontend work: Try Figma + v0.dev?
    - Main idea: Create central state to store age and specific values as the user clicks between and within pages
        - Can send request body in one go after values are chosen (as opposed to sending age, then getting the user_id of that inserted age, and then sending values)
        - Request body updates based on user interaction within and between each page (e.g. select and de-select value from value list, click a back button to change the inputted age)
    - Homepage
        - Email and password text boxes
        - Continue button that routes to /age
    - Age
        - Age text box
        - Next button that routes to /values
